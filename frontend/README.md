# MENN(MongoDB ExpressJS NextJS NodeJS) NFT Marketplace

Welcome to the MENN NFT Marketplace! This is a platform where users can explore, buy, and sell NFTs. The application is built using Next.js and integrates with blockchain technologies.

## Environment Variables

The application uses several environment variables to configure different aspects of the project for various environments (development, production, etc.).

### 1. `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEVELOPMENT_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000`

- **Purpose**: This variable holds the URL of the backend server during development. It points to a locally running backend (usually on `localhost` at port 5000).
- **When Used**: This will be used by the frontend when making API calls during the development stage to interact with your backend.

### 2. `NEXT_PUBLIC_PRODUCTION_BACKEND_URL=`

- **Purpose**: This variable stores the URL for the backend server in a production environment.
- **When Used**: This URL will be used when the app is deployed in production to make API calls to the production backend.

### 3. `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENV=development`

- **Purpose**: This variable specifies the environment the app is running in (either development or production).
- **When Used**: It helps the application know whether it is in a development or production environment and allows conditional changes in behavior (e.g., using different API endpoints for development vs. production).

## Getting Started: Running locally

To run the development server, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Once the server is running, open the following URL in your browser to see the app:

#### [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

This will launch the app on your local machine.

## Deployment to Production

When deploying to production (e.g., Vercel), **don't forget to supply the list of environment variables and their values**.

### Important:

- In production, make sure to set the environment variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENV` to `production`.
- In production, the value for `NEXT_PUBLIC_PRODUCTION_BACKEND_URL` will be the URL of deployed backend on platform like Render, Back4App, etc.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENV` only responds to either value `production` or `development` when assigned. 

Here is an example of the environment variables:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEVELOPMENT_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000
NEXT_PUBLIC_PRODUCTION_BACKEND_URL=<production_backend_url>
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENV=production
```

## Pages and Their Functions

Hereâ€™s a list of the key pages in the app and what they display:

### 1. **Home Page** (`/`)
- Displays featured NFTs and marketplace announcements.

### 2. **Explore Page** (`/explore`)
- Allows users to browse available NFTs and collections.

### 3. **NFT Details Page** (`/nftDetails/[id]`)
- Provides detailed information about a specific NFT.

### 4. **Buy Page** (`/buy`)
- Allows users to purchase NFTs from the marketplace.

### 5. **List Page** (`/list`)
- Lets users list their NFTs for sale in the marketplace.

### 6. **Account Page** (`/account`)
- Displays the user\'s profile, wallet info, and transaction history.

### 7. **Search Page** (`/search`)
- Provides a search functionality to find NFTs based on different criteria.

### 8. **See All Page** (`/see-all`)
- Displays all NFTs or collections available, with pagination.

### 9. **News Page** (`/news`)
- Shows the latest updates and news related to the platform.

### 10. **News Details Page** (`/news/[id]`)
- Displays detailed information for a specific news article.

## Context Used in Frontend

In this project, **React Context** is utilized to manage global states across various components, enabling shared data without prop-drilling. Below are the primary contexts in use:

### 1. `WalletContext`
Manages the wallet connection state, storing the connection status and the wallet address.

- **Purpose**: Handles wallet connection, disconnection, and provides the wallet address globally.

### 2. `ConfigContext`
Stores configuration values such as API URLs and environment settings, ensuring easy access throughout the app.

- **Purpose**: Provides global configuration settings like the backend URL and environment type (development/production).

### 3. `OnboardingContext`
Tracks the user's progress in the onboarding process, allowing easy navigation between different steps.

- **Purpose**: Manages the current step in the onboarding flow and provides methods to progress through the steps.

These contexts simplify state management across the app, enhance code readability, and ensure global state accessibility, promoting scalability and maintainability.
